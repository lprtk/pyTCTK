## Overview 

<p align="justify">The objective is to give tools to prepare your text data without having to install anything. Some text cleaning libraries can't be used on professional computers because they need to download files from servers or from urls that are blocked by internet proxies. With pyTCTK, you just need Python and access to GitHub to clean your text data. So it's a library that you can use on your professional computer, that's the goal : a library usable everywhere.<p>

## Content 

For the moment, three class with several functions are available:
<ul> 
<li><p align="justify">The TextNet class implements all the general functions to clean up your text (remove punctuation, uppercase, email address, urls, html tags, etc.);</p></li> 
<li><p align="justify">The WordNet class implements all the functions to perform more precise cleaning at the word level of your text (remove stopwords or apply lemming or stemming);</p></li>
<li><p align="justify">The Tokenize class implements all two functions to tokenize and detokenize the words in your text.</p></li>
</ul>
